Philippe Miron is a Research Faculty at the [Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies (Florida State University)](https://www.coaps.fsu.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

He turns geoscience data into scientific results using nonlinear dynamic techniques. He completed his undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering and his Ph. D. in Experimental Fluid Dynamics at Polytechnique Montr√©al.

He is interested in the dispersion of floating matters (such as plastics and sargassum), the analysis of the overturning circulation, the applications of machine learning techniques for prediction and clustering, and the combination of model and observations data sets. See also the [group's expertise](https://www.coaps.fsu.edu/our-expertise/){:target="_blank"} for more information on the latest projects.

When he is not in front of the computer, he can be found enjoying the beach, diving, running, cycling, or exploring new places.
